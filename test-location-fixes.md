# Location Management Fix Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

1. **Location Saving Issue**: City, state, and ZIP code fields now save properly to the database
2. **Map Display Issue**: Maps now show only locations stored in the database instead of static file data
3. **Data Transformation**: Fixed the database transformation to include city, state, zipCode, and water_fountains fields

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Database Transformation (`src/lib/database.ts`)
- Added missing `city`, `state`, `zipCode` fields to `transformLocation` function
- Fixed `waterFountains` to use `water_fountains` database field instead of `restrooms` fallback

### 2. Updated Map Data Sources
- `src/data/supabase.ts`: `getAllLocations()` now loads from database with fallback to static data
- `src/components/pages/ScheduleOverview.tsx`: Now loads locations from database
- `src/components/pages/ScheduleDemo.tsx`: Now loads locations from database  
- `src/components/sections/ContactInfo.tsx`: Now loads locations from database

### 3. Location Form Already Correct
- The LocationManagement form was already sending correct data with city, state, zip_code fields
- The issue was in the transformation layer, not the form itself

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Location Creation
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Locations
2. Click "Add New Location"
3. Fill in all fields including:
   - City: "Test City"
   - State: "IA" 
   - ZIP Code: "12345"
4. Save the location
5. Verify in admin list that all fields are displayed

### 2. Test Location Editing
1. Click "Edit" on an existing location
2. Modify city, state, and ZIP code
3. Save changes
4. Verify changes are reflected in the admin list

### 3. Test Map Display
1. Visit any page with a map (Schedule pages, Contact page)
2. Verify only database locations appear as pins
3. If database is empty, should fall back to static data (2 locations)

### 4. Test Database vs Static Data
1. **Clear database locations**: The database should have locations after running migrations
2. **Check map fallback**: If no database locations, maps show static file data
3. **Add database location**: New locations should appear on all maps

## Database Verification

You can verify the fix worked by running this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Check if locations have city, state, zip_code data
SELECT name, city, state, zip_code, water_fountains 
FROM locations 
ORDER BY name;
```

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Location admin form saves city, state, ZIP code
- ✅ Maps display only database locations (with fallback to static data)
- ✅ Location editing preserves all field data
- ✅ Water fountains field works correctly

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify database migrations ran successfully
3. Check that locations table has city, state, zip_code, water_fountains columns
4. Ensure admin user has proper permissions for locations table
